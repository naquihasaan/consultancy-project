  					<h6></h6>
  					<p><b></b></p>
  					<p>Tareeqa polished & trained my personality in a more professional manner, keeping in view each & every small detail required to face any interview process. From learning to build confidence to impressing with expected body language & gestures and presentation skills, my nervousness became more disciplined. Tareeqa helped me create a platform & publish high converting opportunities in the most relevant channels for my career.</p>

  					<h6></h6>
  					<p><b></b></p>
  					<p>Tareeqa has an exceptional work ethic, that translates into all that they teaches. I was on the track of mental exhaustion & frustrated of the consecutive lost opportunities in the interviews. My shaky personality started to embarrass me. A spark was lit after joining the personality development sessions at Tareeqa & learning the supportive tasks.</p>

  					<p><b></b></p>
  					<p>The inability to use a proper sequence of words & expressions always kept me at the side-corner from socialising with people. I feared to come into contact to any superior person. I was hesitant. But, the team at Tareeqa are always willing to help you. It is an excellent example of developing the art of effective communication & leadership skills.</p>

  					<h6></h6>
  					<p><b></b></p>
  					<p>I was bounded into the zone of aggressiveness, complaining about every small odds, restlessness, impulsivity, self-centredness, paid too little attention on the outcomes of such an intolerant behaviour that also kept me distant from my known people. Tareeqa's tools like, ' practical ways to get out' enabled me to execute the kind of composed approach I was looking for that took my old behaviour to a different level.</p>
